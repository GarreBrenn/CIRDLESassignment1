Design a system that has a class for some object (Person, car,e tc)
	- attributes
	- serialize/deserialize static methods

	- serialize saves the state of the object into a .csv
	- use nio instead of io for this ^

	- deserialize takes the .csv

	- override equals() to compare objects of this class

Have a driver (NOT THE MAIN) that instantiates an object of the class
	- ask for characteristics of the object to create it
	- ask for a filename.csv

	- serialize the object

	- create a duplicate of that first object (to compare)

	- deserialize the object and assign the attributes

	- call a test method that uses compareTo() (a method of the object class) (changing the .csv by one character, for example, would fail this test)
